# PokemonReactJS

This project aims to create a simple web application using ReactJS that displays a list of pokemons and allows users to view their details. The application is built using the ReactJS framework, along with React-Bootstrap for styling purposes. The data for the pokemons is obtained from the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2), and the images are retrieved from https://github.com/PokeAPI/sprites.
The main page of the application displays a list of pokemons, each with its name and an image. The user can click on a pokemon to view its details, which include the pokemon's type, weight, height, abilities, moves, and stats. This information is displayed in an organized and user-friendly manner, making it easy for users to quickly find the information they need.

# Purpose

The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills and abilities as a potential intern at PT Gravel. By building a simple web application using ReactJS and incorporating features such as displaying a list of pokemons and viewing their details, I aim to demonstrate my proficiency in these technologies and my ability to follow technical requirements and functional specifications.

# Technologies Used
1. ReactJS: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
2. React-Bootstrap: a library that provides pre-built components for ReactJS applications
3. PokeAPI: a RESTful API for retrieving Pokemon data
